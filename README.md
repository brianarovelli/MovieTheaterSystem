# Movie Theater System designed to enhance consumer experience and bolster profits for prospective clients.

# User functionality includes ability to create/delete accounts, buy tickets to current movie showings at the clients' theaters, recieve discounts through a points-reward system specifically tailored according to client's specifications. They can also write reviews to these movies.

# Administrators & Employees representing the client's company have the ability to do all the same things as the consumers, but can also add/delete movies. However, a unique part about our design involves the web-scraping aspect of how are JSON files operate. Automating the process a bit for administrators & employees.

# The video below is our virtual presentation to a prospective buyer, including a walkthrough of our prototype that was made using proto.io.
